    Support android.content classes to assist with development of applications for
android API level 4 or later.  The main features here are
<c><see cref="T:Android.Support.V4.Content.Loader" /></c> and related classes and
<c><see cref="T:Android.Support.V4.Content.LocalBroadcastManager" /></c> to
provide a cleaner implementation of broadcasts that don't need to go outside
of an app.
