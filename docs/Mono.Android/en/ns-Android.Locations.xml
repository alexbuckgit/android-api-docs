The
<see cref="N:Com.Google.Android.Gms.Location" />,
part of Google Play services, is the preferred way to add location-awareness to
your app. It offers a simpler API, higher accuracy, low-power geofencing, and
more. If you are currently using the android.location API, you are strongly
encouraged to switch to the Google Location Services API as soon as
possible.
