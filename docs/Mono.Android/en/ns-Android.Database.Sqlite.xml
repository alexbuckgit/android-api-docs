    Contains the SQLite database management
classes that an application would use to manage its own private database.
<para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">
Applications use these classes to manage private databases. If creating a
content provider, you will probably have to use these classes to create and
manage your own database to store content. See <format type="text/html"><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/../guide/topics/providers/content-providers.html">Content Providers</a></format> to learn
the conventions for implementing a content provider. See the
NotePadProvider class in the NotePad sample application in the SDK for an
example of a content provider. Android ships with SQLite version 3.4.0
</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">If you are working with data sent to you by a provider, you will not use
these SQLite classes, but instead use the generic <c><see cref="N:Android.Database" /></c>
classes.
</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Android ships with the sqlite3 database tool in the <c>tools/</c>
folder. You can use this tool to browse or run SQL commands on the device. Run by
typing <c>sqlite3</c> in a shell window.
