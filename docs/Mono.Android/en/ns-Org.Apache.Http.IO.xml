    <remarks>
    The transport layer abstraction of the HTTP components.

This layer is used to transfer messages over connections.
Connections are typically based on sockets: plain or secure,
direct or via SOCKS hosts, with bandwidth throttling, or
whatever else you might think of.
However, opening connections is not within the responsibility
of HttpCore.
