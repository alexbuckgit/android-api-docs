    <remarks>
    Framework classes for interaction between views and input methods (such
as soft keyboards).  See <c><see cref="T:Android.Views.InputMethods.InputMethodManager" /></c> for
an overview.  In most cases the main classes here are not needed for
most applications, since they are dealt with for you by
<c><see cref="T:Android.Widget.TextView" /></c>.  When implementing a custom text editor,
however, you will need to implement the
<c><see cref="T:Android.Views.InputMethods.InputConnection" /></c> class to allow the current
input method to interact with your view.
