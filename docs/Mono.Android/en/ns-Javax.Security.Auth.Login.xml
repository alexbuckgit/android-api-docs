This package provides a pluggable and stackable authentication system based on
ideas and concepts from the Unix-PAM module. New authentication methods can be
specified simply via a new LoginModule and chained together with the existing
ones.

Note that the current implementation of this package is not complete, that is,
not compatible with desktop implementations of the Java programming language.
It contains only what was needed to make the compiler happy, that is, classes
required by other packages.
