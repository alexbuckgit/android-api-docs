    that you can use to create simple animations: <i>tweened
        animation</i>, in which you tell Android to perform a series of simple
    transformations (position, size, rotation, and so on) to the content of a
    View; and <i>frame-by-frame animation</i>, which loads a series of Drawable resources
    one after the other. Both animation types can be used in any View object
    to provide simple rotating timers, activity icons, and other useful UI elements.
    Tweened animation is handled by this package (android.view.animation); frame-by-frame animation is
    handled by the <c><see cref="T:Android.Graphics.Drawables.AnimationDrawable" /></c> class.
