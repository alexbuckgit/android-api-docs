This package provides classes and interfaces needed to interact with the
application in order to execute the authentication and authorization
processes. It is a classical callback mechanism: one retrieves information (i.e.
for authentication purposes) and one display some messages (for example error
messages).

Note that the current implementation of this package is not complete, that is,
not compatible with desktop implementations of the Java programming language.
It contains only what was needed to make the compiler happy, that is, classes
required by other packages.
