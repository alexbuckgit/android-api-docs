Provides classes for implementing print services. Print services are plug-in components
that know how to talk to printers via some standard protocols. These services serve as a
bridge between the system and the printers. Hence, the printer and print protocol specific
implementation is factored out of the system and can be independently developed and updated.

A print service implementation should extend <c><see cref="T:Android.PrintServices.PrintService" /></c>
and implement its abstract methods. Also the print service has to follow the contract for
managing <c><see cref="T:Android.PrintServices.PrintJob" /></c>s.

The system is responsible for starting and stopping a print service depending on whether
there are active print jobs for the printers managed by the service. The print service
should also perform printer discovery in a timely fashion to ensure good user experience.
The interaction between the system and the print service during printer discovery is
encapsulated by a <c><see cref="T:Android.PrintServices.PrinterDiscoverySession" /></c> instance created
by the print service when requested by the system.
