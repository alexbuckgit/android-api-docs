To perform Bluetooth communication using these APIs, an application must
declare the <c><see cref="!:NoType:android/Manifest$permission;Href=../../../reference/android/Manifest.permission.html#BLUETOOTH" /></c> permission. Some
additional functionality, such as requesting device discovery,
also requires the <c><see cref="F:Android.Manifest+Permission.BluetoothAdmin" /></c>
permission.
