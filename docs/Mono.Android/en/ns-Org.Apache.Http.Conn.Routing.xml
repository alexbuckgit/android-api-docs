An <c><see cref="T:Org.Apache.Http.Conn.Routing.HttpRoute" /></c>
is the path along which a request has to be sent to the server.
The route starts at a local network address and may pass
through one or more proxies before reaching the target.
Routes through proxies can be tunnelled, and a layered protocol (TLS/SSL)
might be put on top of the tunnel.
The <c><see cref="T:Org.Apache.Http.Conn.Routing.RouteTracker" /></c>
helps in tracking the steps for establishing a route, while an
<c><see cref="T:Org.Apache.Http.Conn.Routing.HttpRouteDirector" /></c>
determines the next step to take.
</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">
The <c><see cref="T:Org.Apache.Http.Conn.Routing.IHttpRoutePlanner" /></c>
is responsible for determining a route to a given target host.
Implementations must know about proxies to use, and about exemptions
for hosts that should be contacted directly without a proxy.
