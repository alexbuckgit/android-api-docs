An "app widget host" is
a component that can contain app widgets (such as the Home screen).</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">Any application can publish app widgets (as an app widget provider).  All an application needs to
do to publish an app widget is
provide a <c><see cref="T:Android.Content.BroadcastReceiver" /></c> that receives the <c><see cref="F:Android.Appwidget.AppWidgetManager.ActionAppwidgetUpdate" /></c> intent
and provide some metadata about the app widget.  Android provides the
<c><see cref="T:Android.Appwidget.AppWidgetProvider" /></c> class, which extends <c><see cref="T:Android.Content.BroadcastReceiver" /></c>, as a convenience class to define the app widget behavrio and aid
in handling the broadcasts.</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">App widget hosts are the containers in which widgets can be placed.  Most of the look and feel
details are left up to the widget hosts.  For example, the home screen has one way of viewing
widgets, but the lock screen could also contain widgets, and it would have a different way of
adding, removing and otherwise managing widgets.</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">For information about implementing an app widget host, see the <c><see cref="T:Android.Appwidget.AppWidgetHost" /></c> class.</para></remarks>
