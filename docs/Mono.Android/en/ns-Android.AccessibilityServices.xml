  An <c><see cref="T:Android.AccessibilityServices.AccessibilityService" /></c> runs in the background and
  receives callbacks by the system when <c><see cref="T:Android.Views.Accessibility.AccessibilityEvent" /></c>s
  are fired. Such events denote some state transition in the user interface, for example, the
  focus has changed, a button has been clicked, etc. Such a service can optionally request the
  capability for querying the content of the active window. Development of an accessibility
  service requires extends this class and implements its abstract methods.
