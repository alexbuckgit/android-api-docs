view hiearchies.</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">A <format type="text/html"><b>Scene</b></format> is an encapsulation of the state of a view hierarchy,
including the views in that hierarchy and the various values (layout-related
and otherwise) that those views have. A scene can be defined by a layout hierarchy
directly or by code which sets up the scene dynamically as it is entered.</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc">A <format type="text/html"><b>Transition</b></format> is a mechanism to automatically animate changes that occur
when a new scene is entered. Some transition capabilities are automatic. That
is, entering a scene may cause animations to run which fade out views that
go away, changeBounds and resize existing views that change, and fade in views that
become visible. There are additional transitions that can animate other
attributes, such as color changes, and which can optionally be specified
to take place during particular scene changes. Finally, developers can
define their own Transition subclasses which monitor particular property
changes and which run custom animations when those properties change values.</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc"><format type="text/html"><b>TransitionManager</b></format> is used to specify custom transitions for particular
scene changes, and to cause scene changes with specific transitions to
take place.</para></remarks>
