  The classes in this package are used to represent screen content and changes to it
  as well as APIs for querying the global accessibility state of the system.
</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc"><c><see cref="T:Android.Views.Accessibility.AccessibilityEvent" /></c>s are sent by the system when
  something notable happens in the user interface. For example, when a
  <c><see cref="T:Android.Widget.Button" /></c> is clicked, a <c><see cref="T:Android.Views.View" /></c> is focused, etc.
</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc"><c><see cref="T:Android.Views.Accessibility.AccessibilityRecord" /></c> contains information
  about state change of its source <c><see cref="T:Android.Views.View" /></c>. When a view fires
  an accessibility event it requests from its parent to dispatch the
  constructed event. The parent may optionally append a record for itself for
  providing more context to <c><see cref="T:Android.AccessibilityServices.AccessibilityService" /></c>s.
  Hence, accessibility services can facilitate additional accessibility records
  to enhance feedback.
</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc"><c><see cref="T:Android.Views.Accessibility.AccessibilityNodeInfo" /></c> represents a node of the
  window content as well as actions that can be requested from its source. From the point
  of view of an <c><see cref="T:Android.AccessibilityServices.AccessibilityService" /></c> a window content is
  presented as tree of accessibility node info which may or may not map one-to-one
  to the view hierarchy. In other words, a custom view is free to report itself as
  a tree of accessibility node info.
</para><para tool="javadoc-to-mdoc"><c><see cref="T:Android.Views.Accessibility.AccessibilityManager" /></c> is a system level service that
  serves as an event dispatch for  <c><see cref="T:Android.Views.Accessibility.AccessibilityEvent" /></c>s,
  and provides facilities for querying the accessibility state of the system. Accessibility
  events are generated when something notable happens in the user interface, for example an
  <c><see cref="T:Android.App.Activity" /></c> starts, the focus or selection of a <c><see cref="T:Android.Views.View" /></c>
  changes etc. Parties interested in handling accessibility events implement and register an
  accessibility service which extends <c><see cref="T:Android.AccessibilityServices.AccessibilityService" /></c>.
