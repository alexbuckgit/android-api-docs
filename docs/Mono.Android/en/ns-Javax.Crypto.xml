Stream ciphers are supported as well as asymmetric, symmetric and block ciphers. Cipher implementations from different providers can be integrated using
the SPI (Service Provider Interface) abstract classes. With class <c><see cref="T:Javax.Crypto.SealedObject" /></c> a programmer can secure an object by
encrypting it with a cipher.
